We will create a FastAPI app with the following core classes, functions, and methods:

1. `User`: A dataclass representing a user with attributes like `id`, `email`, `password`, and `name`.
2. `create_user`: A function to create a new user in Firebase.
3. `get_user`: A function to get a user from Firebase by their email.
4. `authenticate_user`: A function to authenticate a user using their email and password.
5. `request_openai`: A function to send a request to OpenAI's ChatGPT3.5 LLM with the given API body and return the simplified text.

Now, let's create the necessary files and their content.
